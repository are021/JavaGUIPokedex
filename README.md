# JavaGUIPokedex

This is a finalized JavaGUI Pokedex I created in Java using the JSwing library. This was a project I decided to do, as it helped me to understand the fundamentals of java, such as class creation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction , encapsulation, and how to use data structures such as arrays and hash maps in java!

I used a python script with the requests library and the python pillow library to download images for the 151 pokemon.
I gathered these images from this link: https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex

Please enjoy!
